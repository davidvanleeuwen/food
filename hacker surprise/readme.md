It's time to have some fun with chocolate üç´üç´üç´!

I'm part of a community, which is a hackerspace in Rotterdam called Pixelbar. And we had this brilliant idea to create a better version of Kinder Surprise. Instead of getting surprised with a disappointment (a simple piece of plastic, which is can sometimes be fun for kids), we instead wanted to add a small solder project in there - for hackers.

## A quick introduction

Tempering chocolate is pretty hard to do, especially when creating a large batch. The best way to learn, is to look at the experts. So look at the video from the factory [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ols7xO_xbU). As you can see, they use a mold and fill it up with chocolate. Then they throw out the chocolate and it sticks to the plastic mold. Apparently they use the temperature to control the flow of the chocolate.

## Tempering

So we'll start by doing some research first. I love the approach from [Alex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-EKcYqKEec). Instead of using the room temperature and the traditional chocolate tempering method, there is another method where you simply let the chocolate melt and then removing it from the heat and adding a few pieces of chocolate to the pot. Oh, and it's very important to use a souse-vide, which you can easily do almost boiling water (around 60¬∞C) and adding a bowl above the pan. You add the chocolate in there. A easy trick to get it more smooth is to add some sunflower oil in there, just a little bit though.

It's an exact science, but don't be afraid if you don't get it precise (I didn't and it turned out nice). It's fun to do and you don't need to be a professional to create something.

This is my setup:

## Pouring

Once you got your bowl with milk chocolate ready, you need to fill the mold. Fill it up and then right after poor it out. Make sure to shake it (and keep the left overs for another batch). However, make sure to check how thick the walls when you're shaking, because the more you shake, the thinner the walls will get. You can get it very thin!

Obviously you'll also want to melt down some white chocolate. It's the same process as before, but make sure that your milk chocolate is already a bit hardened, but not too much! If it's completely hardened than the two won't bind and you'll end up with an egg that will fall apart.

## Shaping the egg

Because I used a hard plastic mold (mostly you see silicon molds), you need another process to remove it from the mold. I used hard plastic molds, as they use that in the factory. To move it from the mold the trick is to put it in your freezer for a while (around 30 minutes). You'll notice the air flowing on the outside in between the mold and the chocolate. When that occurs it's ready to be removed. Be sure to remove any overflowing chocolate that has hardened (with a knive). If you don't, you might end up with broken edges.

Once you have multiple halve eggs, you can put them together. Simply put a metal plate on top of your water (instead of the bowl, you need something that is flat). Now you put the edges of the two halves on the plate for just a second, move it a round a bit and put the halves together. Tada! A kinder surprise.
