こんにちは! Hello there!

If you ever have visited Japan and spent your time at ramen places (which would be very likely), you know that there's lots of different types of ramen with lots of variations. There is no perfect ramen, because it all depends on your taste and what you like. But if you ever had that steamy bowl of flavors, you just can't have enough. There's fatty ramen like [Tonkotsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkotsu_ramen) to more umami style ramen like [Miso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miso) ramen. This is my take on creating the "perfect" ramen.

### A quick introduction

Ramen's origin is presumably Chinese, as it was called Hina Soba (Chinese Soba) and early 1900's it started becoming its own thing in Japan. From that point, Japanese started experimenting with lots of different flavors, where every area in Japan developed its own style of ramen.

Although the many different variants, it all consists out of 4 elements: broth, flavoring, noodles and toppings. The one I've been focussing on is Shoyu ramen. Where ramen, as you might already understand, is the dish type (noodles) and Shoyu defines the flavour base you use, which in this case means soy sauce.

This dish is one of the most traditional types of ramen and probably one of the easiest ones to try out yourself.

### Step by step

Ok, so, you probably expect some kind of tutorial here. Although I hope you get some information out of this article, I really hope you can give me feedback on how to improve the techniques I'm using. However, if you do want use this as your source of making your own ramen, I would really recommened looking up some actual recipes.

First off, getting the ingredients:

**Broth**
* Kombu (seaweed)
* Katsuobushi/bonito flakes (dried shaved fish, most of the times is tuna)
* Lots of vegetables (carrots, scallions etc.)
* Ginger and garlic
* Chicken parts
* Pork belly or shoulder
