# Food

> A list of food experiments / research that I'd like to share

Are you as obsessed over food as I am? Eating it, the history behind it, preparing it, seeing other people eat it, the ingredients, the farmers, the way how it was processed... everything about food is just facinating to me. Hopefully you can give me some feedback, tips and/or suggestions. Currently I'm really into fermentation, so any help there would be much appreciated. Or maybe you can even learn something from what I've been doing, check it out:
