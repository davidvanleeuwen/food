This is a post about Simon's Hot Sauce. Meow! üêà 

The idea behind is to create a sauce that is a bit spicy, but not too much and has some more depth to it - so fermented!

## Before we start

Before you continue, please read my post about the [cybergarden](https://github.com/davidvanleeuwen/food/tree/master/hot%20sauce/cybergarden) too. Because at the end of the line, it's all about the peppers you use as it will determine most of its flavor. So finding good peppers, or growing them yourself is key in all this process.

This will be the end result of my usage of the sauce:

## The ingredients

- [Fresno Chilli peppers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_Chili_pepper)
- Water
- Carrots
- Garlic
- (Apple Cider) Vinegar
- Sugar
- Xantham Gum

I've used Fresno peppers and had 3.5kg of it. You need the same amount of carrots. You need a lot of garlic too, I used around 90 pieces of garlic. The first step is cutting that all to smaller pieces. Don't worry too much about it, as you'll end up blending it anyways.

Note: be sure to wear gloves, because if you cut a lot of peppers - the smell/hotness will stay around for days and your fingers will probably hurt.

## Fermentation

Once you have cut the above ingredients, you need a container of some sort to hold it with lots of water. I used a plastic fermentation vessel for beer brewing (which will definitely influence the next beer batch). The important part is to put enough water in so everything is submerged. Just make sure there's a lot of water in there, but you'll need to measure how much. You will need to add salt to the water and there's a ratio to it: 25 grams of salt per liter of water. Now using a cheese cloth, or  baking paper cover to the top. It's important that all ingredients stay under water. To do so, there's a trick which you can use. Use the same ratio and fill up plastic bags with salty water (so for when it leaks it doesn't mess up the ratio in the vessel). Now carefully place the bags on top of your cheese cloth/baking paper and add more bags if needed to make sure it's all submerged.

Let this fermented for about 7 days. Check every day to make sure everything is still submerged. Check every day for the taste, it should get more sour and once you think it's ready, get all the vegetables out. Move this to a large pot and blender it until smooth. If it's hard to blend, add some of the water.

## Making the sauce

Now you need to strain the mixture and use the puree. You don't need the solids for the sauce, but I recommend making sambal with it. Add around 200 grams of sugar (if you want it to be less our, add some more sugar) and 1.5 liters of vinegar. Mix that all together.

The last step of making the sauce is adding Xantham Gum, which is a thickener (from sugar). I added around 50 grams to it, but make sure to slow add it and mix it and keeping an eye out on the desired texture. My sauce was similar to the texture of ketchup.

## Bottling and labeling

I found some nice bottles which had the shape I wanted. But you can use anything made out of glass and what you can properly close. Weck bottles work perfectly, but I used a bottle with a screwcap so I can hand them out easily. Put on a pan with boiling water and boil all bottles. I also used a desinfencted spray and gloves for this process, because you really want to make sure everything (you can touch, so also the tools) doesn't get infected. It would be a bummer if your complete batch is ruined by on simple step.

Once the sauce was added to the bottles I boiled them for a bit more to make sure their closed well and clean. The next step was to add a logo and etiquettes. Simon was my cat, but there are more references to [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(cat)) and [Simon's cat](https://simonscat.com/).
