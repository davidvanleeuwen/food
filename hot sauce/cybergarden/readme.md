Hi ðŸ‘‹ and be ready for some ðŸŒ¶!!

To make hot sauce you need a few ingredients. The main ingredient are peppers, but instead of simply buying them I decided to buy some seeds from [peperzaden.nl](http://peperzaden.nl/) and start growing them. However, I'm not really a gardening person and I'm by all means no expert on peppers ([these are experts](https://cpi.nmsu.edu)). Therefor I decided to do it a bit differently...

## Quick introduction
Before I started I bought some peppers and thought to myself that I could simply use the seeds to make more. So I got a few pepers to try out the taste and made it into a sambal. But I quickly realised this stuff is too inconsistent and not really the best flavor to proceed. So I did some research and figured I needed to work with [Fresno chili peppers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_Chili_pepper) instead. Oh, and this will be my first fermentation project.

This is the result we'll have technically
